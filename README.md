CLOTHIFY - ONLINE CLOTHING STORE

Clothify is a fully responsive online clothing store website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse, shop, and interact with products in an easy and engaging way. Below is how the website works:

1. PRODUCT DISPLAY
   - The homepage shows multiple clothing products in a neat, responsive grid.
   - Each product has an image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

2. CART FUNCTIONALITY
   - Users can add items to the cart and view them on the Cart page.
   - Items can be removed if no longer needed.
   - Cart data is saved in the browser (localStorage), so it remains available while navigating between pages.

3. CHECKOUT AND PAYMENTS
   - The checkout page displays the total and allows the customer to proceed to payment.
   - Payments can be integrated with IntaSend, allowing M-Pesa, card, and other supported methods.

4. BOOKING AND RETURNS
   - The Booking page lets users reserve an item for later purchase.
   - The Return page allows customers to initiate product returns.

5. CONTACT FORM
   - The contact page has a form for inquiries or feedback.
   - This form can be connected to Formspree or another form-handling service to send messages to your email.

6. DESIGN AND INTERACTIVITY
   - The site has a professional look with a background image, animations, hover effects, and toast notifications.
   - It is mobile-friendly and works across devices.

7. DEPLOYMENT
   - The entire project is static and easy to host on GitHub Pages.
   - Simply upload the files to your repository and enable GitHub Pages to make the site live.

Clothify is a great starter project for anyone who wants to showcase clothing products online and can easily be customized with your own images, colors, and branding.
